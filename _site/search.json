    "text": "My name is Maranganty Saikiran Reddy, and I am currently pursuing an MS in Data Analytics Engineering at George Mason University. I am passionate about data analytics and aim to leverage insights to drive innovation and business foresight. My academic journey began at Chinmaya Vidyalaya (78% aggregate) and Sri Chaitanya Junior Kalsala (91.7%), where I developed strong logical and mathematical skills. I later earned a BTech in Computer Science from Malla Reddy Engineering College, where I gained expertise in languages like C, Java, and Python. I have worked on projects like “Traffic Sign Recognition” and “Farm Insects Identification” and served as a Student Coordinator for Akshara 2023. I also interned as a Web Developer at Path Creators. Post-graduation, I plan to pursue roles as a Machine Learning Engineer or Data Scientist, aiming to contribute to innovative solutions in the IT industry."
